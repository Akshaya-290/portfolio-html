<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Akshaya, a B.Tech graduate from ANITS, majoring in ECE. I love to try out and explore a lot of things, out of which Web development is one of them. This is the website which I created with the knowledge and projects I have completed until now. I would love to get hands on experience and some internships based on this. If you are interested in the progress I have shown, and are willing to provide me oppurtunities to work, you can contact me through Mail or Whatsapp. Until then, Ciao!! </p>
